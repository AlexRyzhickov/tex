\begin{abstract}
  We study conjunctive partial deduction, an advanced specialization technique aimed at improving the performance of logic programs, in the context of relational programming language \mk. We identify a number of issues, caused by  \mk peculiarities, and describe a novel approach to specialization based on partial deduction and supercompilation. The results of the evaluation demonstrate successful specialization of relational interpreters. Although the project is at the early stages, we consider it as the first step towards an efficient optimization framework for  \mk.
