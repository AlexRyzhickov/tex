\subsection*{Review 5}

Post-review:

The paper has been improved significantly. I enjoyed reading the examples in detail. The points about the evaluation are well taken. I'm looking forward to the follow-up work.

Minor point:

num/sum in Listing 1 are barely readable (but in the text below they read fine).
